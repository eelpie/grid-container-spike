* Remove shared config

Boot strap applications with Play config

Need thrall to start and create the empty elastic index.

* Add basic thrall application.conf

Grid Play version only works with Java 8
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home/

sbt thrall/run

domain.root not found because CommonConfig is looking for Guardian native properties files.

Want CommonConfig to respect Play config or the Play app to be able to bypass CommonConfig.
ThrallConfig has a reference to Play config should do as much as it can from this rather than CommonConfig.
