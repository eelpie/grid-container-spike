* Remove shared config

Boot strap applications with Play config

Need thrall to start and create the empty elastic index.

* Add basic thrall application.conf

Grid Play version only works with Java 8
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_60.jdk/Contents/Home/

sbt thrall/run

domain.root not found because CommonConfig is looking for Guardian native properties files.

thrall is not interested in service urls so dropped in from common config;
let services who are interested mix in directly.

Want CommonConfig to respect Play config or the Play app to be able to bypass CommonConfig.
ThrallConfig has a reference to Play config should do as much as it can from this rather than CommonConfig.
